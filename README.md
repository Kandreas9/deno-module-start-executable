This repository is for the lazy deno module developers (like me, probably only me)
that dont want to create the same deno module setup every time.

# DOC

1. Clone the repository (green CODE button)
2. Place the repository in your projects folder
3. Navigate through the console to this repository in your local files
4. Execute `deno run --allow-read --allow-write index.ts`

It will always place the root dir outside of the repos root with a name of
Deno-Module-Kit. I tried to make this a single file executable but got too many
error and decided to just leave it at that its just one command anyway.
